## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (Version 18.x or higher recommended)
- `npm` (Version 8.x or higher)
- Firebase account and project

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danasalh/Beit-Berl-Academic-College-s-Social-Engagement-Unit-.git
cd Beit-Berl-Academic-College-s-Social-Engagement-Unit-/beit-berl
```

### Project Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create Firebase project:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google providers)
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Set up Firestore security rules and indexes

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Copy the template below and fill in your Firebase configuration:

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
```

**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Keep your Firebase credentials secure.

### Firebase Setup
1. **Authentication**: Enable Email/Password and Google sign-in methods
2. **Firestore Database**: Create database with appropriate security rules
3. **Firestore Indexes**: Set up composite indexes for efficient querying
4. **Security Rules**: Configure rules based on user roles and permissions 

## Usage

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment
Deploy to Firebase Hosting:
```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

**Note:** Remember to build before every deployment when changes are made.

### Test the Application
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Register a new account (requires admin approval)
3. Once approved, explore the features based on your assigned role
4. Test volunteer hour logging, approval workflows, and notification system

## Data Structure

The application uses Firestore NoSQL database with the following main collections:
- **Users Collection** - User profiles with roles and organization assignments
- **Organizations Collection** - Organization information and settings
- **hoursTracking Collection** - Volunteer hour submissions and approvals
- **Feedback Collection** - Feedback and communications
- **Notifications Collection** - System notifications
- **feedbackReminderTracking Collection** - Automated reminder system

## Best Practices & Development

### Code Standards
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Implement proper error handling
- Maintain consistent code formatting

### Security
- Never expose Firebase credentials in public repositories
- Implement proper Firestore security rules
- Validate user permissions on both client and server side
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Problems:**
- Verify Firebase configuration in `.env` file
- Check if authentication providers are enabled in Firebase Console
- Ensure Firestore security rules allow proper access

**Build/Deployment Issues:**
- Run `npm run build` before deployment
- Check for any TypeScript or linting errors
- Verify all environment variables are properly set

**Database Issues:**
- Check Firestore security rules
- Verify indexes are properly configured
- Monitor Firebase console for any quota limits
